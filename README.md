# My Blog Application

A dynamic blog website built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **EJS**. This application allows users to view blog posts and create new content with support for image uploads.

## 🚀 Features

- **Dynamic Content Rendering**: Posts are dynamically generated using EJS templates.
- **Create Posts**: User-friendly "Create Post" interface.
- **Image Uploads**: Integrated `multer` for handling cover image uploads (fallback to default image if none provided).
- **Responsive Design**: Clean and modern UI that looks great on all devices.
- **RESTful Architecture**: Clean routing structure for viewing and creating content.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

We have exciting plans to enhance the platform! Upcoming features include:

- **Database Integration**: Migrating from local array storage to a real database (MongoDB or PostgreSQL) for persistent data.
- **CRUD Operations**: Adding ability to **Edit** and **Delete** posts.
- **Admin Dashboard**: A dedicated area to manage content.
- **User Authentication**: Login/Signup functionality for authors.
- **Comments Section**: Allowing readers to engage with posts.
- **Rich Text Editor**: Upgrading the content input to support formatting (bold, italic, links).
